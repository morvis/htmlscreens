<div class="memo-blurb">Our conference theme of "Many Voices, One Mission" emphasizes the diversity of our organization across party, race, religion and ethnic origin. We each came to Washington because we believe deeply in strengthening our country's relationship with Israel. We recognize the growing polarization in our country and its impact on Congress. But we want you and your colleagues to know that we are absolutely committed to keeping Israel a bipartisan issue. On every legislative item we support, we work to bring Republicans and Democrats together.</div>
