<br><br>

<strong>During the Conference:</strong>
<ul>

<br><br>
<br><div class="delegate-header">Updates During the Conference</div><br>
 During the conference, check your personalized program for updates about the programs you selected, news about special guests and timely reminders. Electronic signs positioned around conference venues will also provide updates, and you can always check for updates at the Conference Concierge Desks. You may also receive emails, texts or push notifications containing timely reminders about your next event.
<br><br>
<br><div class="delegate-header">Access to Sessions</div><br>
<strong>Reservations Required:</strong> All breakout sessions and many special events require advance registration via the Policy Conference Agenda Builder. Conference staff will scan your badges at the door of each session. Therefore, it is critical that you select your sessions in advance of Policy Conference. To access your Agenda Builder, please log in to your MyAIPAC account at MyAIPAC.org. You will also be able to adjust your schedule onsite via the Quick Stop Kiosks set up throughout the conference venues.
<br><br>
<br><div class="delegate-header">Personalized Schedules</div><br>
We recommend that you print your schedule before you arrive at the conference. Rooms and locations will be visible on your personalized schedule the week before the conference.
<br><br>
To review and print your agenda on site, visit one of the Quick Stop Kiosks located inside the Washington Convention Center in the AIPAC Village or immediately outside of Room 146, or on the M1 level of the Marriott Marquis.
