    <h2 class="button-accordion">Shabbaton</h2>
      <div class="box-accordion">
      Expand your Policy Conference experience by joining us Friday and Saturday for an in-depth educational seminar at the Washington Convention Center. Shabbaton scholars will lead engaging discussions in a restful and respectful Shabbat environment. The $299 fee covers all Shabbaton meals and programming.
      <br><br>
      To register for the Shabbaton, please click here. You can also register using Agenda Builder by selecting Shabbaton 2017 on the “Friday” tab.
      Shabbaton registrants will receive a royal blue ribbon that must be affixed to their Policy Conference badge. This ribbon will allow delegates access into the Shabbaton through the end of Havdalah. Shabbat observant delegates may still be subject to Shabbat-appropriate security procedures.
      </div>
        <br>
    <h2 class="button-accordion">General Sessions and Breakout Sessions</h2>
      <div class="box-accordion">
      <strong>General Sessions</strong><br>
      This year, General Sessions will be held at both the Verizon Center and the Washington Convention Center.  General Sessions will include informative remarks by American and Israeli leaders, compelling discussions with newsmakers, and moving personal stories that will offer delegates an unrivaled experience. You do not want to miss a moment.
      <br><br>
      <strong>General Sessions at the Verizon Center</strong><br>
      To enter the Verizon Center, you will be asked to show your Policy Conference badge and a government-issued photo ID. To help you navigate the arena’s multiple levels, pick up a map showing seating, meeting rooms, food stands and other locations inside the Verizon Center.

      <br><br>
      <strong>Breakout Sessions</strong><br>
      Policy Conference features more than 350 policy briefings and panel discussions. These “breakouts” are smaller and more intimate than General Sessions, and provide you the opportunity to hear from leading national security and political experts and to ask your own questions.
      <br><br>
      All breakout sessions require advance registration. To enter, you will be required to present your badge for scanning. If you haven’t already, please use your Agenda Builder to select your breakout sessions.

    <h2 class="button-accordion">Lobbying Congress</h2>
      <div class="box-accordion">
      Lobbying Congress is at the core of AIPAC’s mission to advance the U.S.-Israel relationship. We encourage all delegates to sign up to lobby; however, it is crucial that all delegates who sign up subsequently attend all their scheduled appointments because members of Congress will be expecting them.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Lobbying Prep & Appointments</strong><br>AIPAC staff members schedule all Policy Conference lobbying appointments. As a delegate, if you sign up to lobby, your PC Agenda Builder will reflect details about your Lobby Caucus Meeting on Monday from 10:45 – 11:45 a.m. and your lobbying appointments on Tuesday.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Lobby Caucus Meetings</strong><br>
      During your Lobby Caucus Meeting on Monday, you will meet your group leader—the individual who will lead your lobbying appointment on Tuesday—and the other delegates with whom you will be lobbying. You will also receive a briefing by an AIPAC staff member about AIPAC’s lobbying agenda and how to make the most of your time on Capitol Hill.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Lobbying Help Desk</strong><br>
      If you would like to sign up to lobby or have any questions, please stop by the Lobbying Help Desk in the AIPAC Village. The Lobbying Help Desk will be open on Saturday from 3 – 9 p.m., on Sunday from 8 a.m. - 10 p.m. and on Monday from 8 a.m. - 3 p.m. On Tuesday, the Lobbying Help Desk will be located in Salon AB and open from 7 a.m. – 1 p.m. If you have questions while on Capitol Hill, reach the Help Desk via email at pclobbying@aipac.org or via text at (202) 670-1532.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Changes</strong><br>
      Lobbying appointment times can change up until the last minute. Appointment times will update automatically in each delegate’s AIPAC Policy Conference 2017 App. In addition, delegates who are registered to receive text message alerts will receive updates via text.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Getting to Capitol Hill</strong><br>
      Following the Tuesday morning general session at the Washington Convention Center, delegates signed up to lobby will be directed to buses for free transportation to Capitol Hill. The drop off location is Garfield Circle, where event staff will provide directions to specific House and Senate buildings.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Getting to Your Appointments</strong><br>
      When you arrive on Capitol Hill, please listen to event staff as they will direct you to building entrances with the shortest lines. You will need to pass through magnetometers when entering any building on Capitol Hill, which can be time consuming. Please arrive early to get through security and reach your appointments on time. In order to help expedite the entry process, do not bring luggage to Capitol Hill and keep bags and purses to a minimum. When moving between appointments, use the tunnels that connect buildings on the House or Senate sides and do not require an additional magnetometer scan. These tunnels help expedite the process of moving between the buildings, as security lines outside can be long.
      <br><br>
      Once inside the buildings, event staff will be located throughout the halls to help direct you to congressional offices. Please meet your group leaders outside each office.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Show Respect</strong><br>
      Remember that lobbying is about building relationships, so it is important that you show respect to lawmakers and their staff, stay on message and always say “thank you.”
      <br><br>
      While on Capitol Hill, please reference the map on your Lobbying Agenda for the locations of the buildings, tunnels, cafeterias and bus pick up points. Food is available for purchase in the cafeterias on the ground floor of Dirksen (Senate side) and the basement of Longworth (House side).
      <br><br>
      <strong>Returning to the Convention Center</strong><br>
      Free buses located at Peace Circle will bring delegates back to the Washington Convention Center and will run until 3:45 p.m. Additional buses located at the Washington Convention Center will bring delegates back to their hotels, and will run until 4:00 p.m.
