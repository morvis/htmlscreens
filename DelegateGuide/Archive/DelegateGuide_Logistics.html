      <div class="box-accordion">
        <strong>Badge Mailing</strong><br>
        Most delegates will receive their badges by mail before the conference. Badges are mailed individually, even when being sent to the same household. Therefore, badges may arrive on different days.
        <br><br>
        Badges will not be mailed to delegates with mailing addresses outside of the United States.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Badge Pick Up</strong><br>If you have not received your badge in the mail, forgotten it at home, or need to make a change to your badge, please visit the Delegate Badge Pick-Up Desk in Salon F of the Washington Convention Center. Please enter the Washington Convention Center using the doors at 7th Street, NW and Mt. Vernon Place.
        <br><br>
        Badges may only be picked up during the scheduled times listed below. You must claim your badge in person; a family member or friend cannot pick it up on your behalf.
        <br><br>
        All children must be registered and must wear a Policy Conference badge. High school delegates who do not have a government-issued photo ID may present a current school-issued photo ID.
        <br><br>
        In the event your badge is lost or stolen, please visit the Delegate Badge Pick-Up Desk and we will void and re-print your badge. Once a badge is voided, it will no longer provide access to conference venues or events.

      <div class="box-accordion">
        The AIPAC Policy Conference takes security very seriously. Badges must be worn and visible at all times.
        <br><br>
        You must present your badge and a government-issued photo ID when entering any conference venue.
        <br><br>
        The name on your badge and your government-issued photo ID must be a match or near match.
        <br><br>
        To enter the Washington Convention Center, the Marriott Marquis and the Verizon Center all delegates must pass through magnetometers. Magnetometers are sensitive to metal. To ensure quicker entrance into conference venues, be prepared to empty your pockets. Place any pins on your lanyard for easy removal.
        <br><br>
        For security reasons, please do not photograph your badge or share it on social media at any time.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Protestors</strong><br>
