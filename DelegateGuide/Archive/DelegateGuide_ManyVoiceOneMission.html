        AIPAC’s strength comes from the diversity of our membership as well as the diversity of the speakers and special guests who participate in the Policy Conference.
        <br><br>
        AIPAC is a bipartisan organization and the Policy Conference features top American and Israeli leaders from across the political spectrum. All of our speakers are guests of AIPAC and the pro-Israel community. We want every person invited into our home to feel welcome and appreciated. Whatever our individual perspectives may be on the range of topics covered during our three days together, we all come to Policy Conference for the same reason – to strengthen the U.S.-Israel relationship.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Please remember that you have a critical role in ensuring everyone has a positive experience during the conference.  Please be courteous and respectful to all speakers, delegates and guests.  </strong>
