<div class="delegate-header">Lobbying Information</div><br>
Lobbying Congress is at the core of AIPAC's mission to advance the U.S.-Israel relationship. We encourage all delegates to sign up to lobby. However, all delegates who sign up must subsequently attend all their scheduled appointments because members of Congress will be expecting them.
<br><br>
<strong>Lobbying Help Desk:</strong> If you would like to sign up to lobby or have any questions, please stop by the Lobbying Help Desk in the AIPAC Village. The Lobbying Help Desk will be open on Saturday from 3:00 – 9:00 p.m., on Sunday from 8:00 a.m. – 10:00 p.m. and on Monday from 8:00 a.m. – 3:00 p.m. On Tuesday, the Lobbying Help Desk will be located in Salon AB and open from 7:00 a.m. – 1:00 p.m. If you have questions while on Capitol Hill, reach the Help Desk via email at pclobbying@aipac.org or via text at (202) 670-1532.
<br><br>
<strong>Changes:</strong> Lobbying appointment times can change up until the last minute. Appointment times will update automatically in the app, your personalized schedule and delegates who are registered to receive text message alerts will receive updates via text.
<br><br>
<strong>Getting to Capitol Hill:</strong> Following the Tuesday Morning General Session at the Washington Convention Center, delegates signed up to lobby will be directed to shuttles to take them to Capitol Hill. The drop off location is Garfield Circle, where event staff will provide directions to specific House and Senate buildings.
<br><br>
<strong>Getting to Your Lobbying Appointments:</strong> When you arrive on Capitol Hill, please listen to the event staff as they will direct you to building entrances that have the shortest lines. You will need to pass through magnetometers when entering any building on Capitol Hill, which can be time consuming. Please arrive early to get through security and reach your appointments on time. To help expedite the entry process, do not bring luggage to Capitol Hill and keep bags and purses to a minimum. When moving between appointments, use the tunnels that connect buildings on the House or Senate sides and do not require an additional magnetometer scan.
<br><br>
Once inside the buildings, event staff will be located throughout the halls to help direct you to congressional offices. Please meet your group leaders outside each office.
<br><br>
<strong>Show Respect:</strong> Remember that lobbying is about building relationships, so it is important that you show respect to lawmakers and their staff, stay on message and always say "thank you."
<br><br>
While on Capitol Hill, please reference the map on your Lobbying Agenda for the locations of the buildings, tunnels, cafeterias and bus pick-up points. Food is available for purchase in the cafeterias on the ground floor of Dirksen (Senate side) and the basement of Longworth (House side).
<br><br>
<strong>Returning to the Convention Center:</strong> Shuttles located at Peace Circle will bring delegates back to the Washington Convention Center and will run until 3:45 p.m. Additional buses located at the Marriot Marquis will bring delegates back to their hotels and will run until 4:00 p.m.
