     <strong>DIRECT TALKS: The Key to Sustainable Peace</strong><br>
   Israel is committed to a two-state solution - a Jewish state living side-by-side in peace with a demilitarized Palestinian state. The United States must send a clear message that this goal can only be achieved through direct negotiations between the parties. Unhelpful resolutions at the United Nations Security Council and unilateral Palestinian actions at other international bodies will only undermine the prospects for peace. America should work together with Israel to counter Palestinian terrorism and incitement to violence, and urge the Palestinians to return to the negotiating table.
   <br><br>
   Direct, bilateral negotiations are the only viable path to achieve an enduring peace. Israelis and Palestinians can only reach a viable peace if they enter negotiations willingly, make key compromises, feel vested in the peace process, and dedicate themselves to implementing a solution. Any peace agreement will require significant concessions from both sides and can only endure with the support of Israeli and Palestinian leadership, along with the people they represent. If the international community allows the Palestinians to abandon negotiations, and yields to their demands irrespective of Israeli concerns, it will encourage Palestinian intransigence and undermine the prospects for an enduring two-state solution.
<br><br>
Regional states can play a constructive role. Israel remains undeterred in its desire for peace with both the Palestinians and its other Arab neighbors - a peace which would benefit all parties. In the past, Israel made significant security and territorial compromises to achieve historic peace treaties with Egypt in 1979 and with Jordan in 1994, to the great benefit of all three countries. In this era of unprecedented chaos in the Middle East, the United States should encourage its Arab allies to take concrete steps towards peace with, recognition of and normalization of relations with Israel. Arab states should also play a constructive role in supporting Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts, including encouraging Palestinian leaders to return to the negotiating table with Israel.
<br><br>
Even before the establishment of Israel in 1948, the Jewish community in thenBritish Mandatory Palestine expressed its desire to live in peace with its Arab neighbors. Since its founding amid the ashes of war, Israel has repeatedly demonstrated its willingness to make bold, painful concessions, such as withdrawingfrom land and forcibly removing its citizens, in order to achieve peace.
