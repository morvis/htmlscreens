     <br>
     Israel has emerged as a leader in developing techniques and technologies for homeland security and counterterrorism. Today, Israel is working with the U.S. government and the private sector to design systems and equipment aimed at thwarting terrorism and safeguarding citizens from both nations. The United States and Israel are exploring cooperation in new areas, from wearable technologies to cyber protection of critical infrastrature.

     <h2 class="button-accordion">TECH SOLUTIONS</h2>
     <div class="box-accordion">
     <strong>FIRST RESPONDER TECHNOLOGY</strong><br>
          In 2016, the Israel-U.S. Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation (BIRD) released a Call for Proposals in partnership with the Israeli Ministry of Public Security and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The program for advanced first response technology invites two unrelated companies - one in Israel and one in the United States - to apply jointly for a grant that will fund up to half of their combined R&D costs.<br><br>This represents the beginning of a three-year pilot program, to be funded at $2 million per year from both the U.S. Government and the Government of Israel. The initiative also included a seminar aimed at improving and advancing this life-saving technology.
     </div><br>
     <h2 class="button-accordion">CYBER EXPERTISE</h2>
     <div class="box-accordion">
     Leaders from around the world visited Israel in January 2016 for CyberTech, the world's largest exhibition of cyber technologies. The conference presented strategies, solutions and technologies to address the global cyber threat to finance, transportation, utilities, defense, research and development, manufacturing, telecommunication, health and government.<br><br>Israel is a leader in cyber. The Israel Defense Forces are creating a unified cyber command, which will act as Israel's first line of defense against hijackings and other online threats.
     </div>
     <br>
     <h2 class="button-accordion">PREPAREDNESS</h2>
     <div class="box-accordion">
         American observers from FEMA and the National Guard often travel to Israel to participate in Israeli homeland security drills. In January 2010, Israel conducted a large-scale bio-terrorism drill simulating a smallpox outbreak caused by a terrorist attack. FEMA and the Israeli National Emergency Authority have signed a formal agreement to conduct more jointtraining drills and exercises.
     </div>
     <br>
     <h2 class="button-accordion">BORDER SECURITY</h2>
     <div class="box-accordion">
     Israel's vast experience protecting its borders from terrorists, and the technologies developed as a result, has been put to use in the United States. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security hired Israeli defense firm Elbit to build surveillance towers for the ArizonaMexico border equipped with radar and cameras that detect human movement.
     </div>
     <br>
     <h2 class="button-accordion">PORT SECURITY</h2>
     <div class="box-accordion">
     The Port of Miami is using Israeli company NICE Systems to improve its video monitoring equipment. The new Israeli system protects the four million travelers who come through the port annually, as well as the 7.4 million tons of goods delivered through the port. In 2014, the American Israel Education Foundation (AIEF) hosted its first-ever port security mission to Israel, bringing experts from both nations together to improve their work.
     </div>
     <br>
     <h2 class="button-accordion">AVIATION SECURITY</h2>
     <div class="box-accordion">
     A 2015 cooperative agreement between the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and Tel Aviv University established the world's first aviation cyber center. The center focuses on R&D for new security initiatives and provides training for IATA personnel. In 2014, Israel, the United States and Canada participated in a joint aviation drill to bolster response procedures against aerial attacks.
     </div>
     <br>
     <h2 class="button-accordion">UNMANNED SYSTEMS</h2>
     <div class="box-accordion">
     The Pentagon awarded Israeli company Roboteam Ltd. a $25 million contract in 2015 to provide advanced unmanned systems that save soldiers' lives. Roboteam has created a collection of portable, lightweight and inexpensive bots that are able to climb stairs, see around corners and detect possible traps. Roboteam's robots made their debut fighting Hamas terror tunnels.
     </div>
     <br>
     <h2 class="button-accordion">EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT</h2>
     <div class="box-accordion">
     A delegation of firefighters from America, including Sept. 11 first responders, traveled to Israel in 2014 to assist their Israeli counterparts in extinguishing fires sparked by barrages of Hamas rockets. The American firefighters brought relief and support to the Israelis combating fires in Sderot and throughout southern Israel, providing much-needed assistance during a critical time.
     </div>
     <br>
     <h2 class="button-accordion">POLICE COOPERATION</h2>
     <div class="box-accordion">
     Israeli police forces train international peers in security procedures ranging from fighting terrorism to preparing for mass casualty emergencies. Israel has worked with multiple elite American law enforcement agencies to provide counterterrorism training techniques. In 2014, AIEF conducted two successful training missions to Israel for American law enforcement officials.
     </div>
     <br>
     <h2 class="button-accordion">MASS TRANSPORTATION</h2>
     <div class="box-accordion">
     Verint, an American company with extensive operations in Israel, has developed a video surveillance security system that is being used at LaGuardia, JFK and Newark Airports and the Port of Beaumont in Texas. The technology has been certified as an anti-terrorism technology by the Department of Homeland Security.
     </div>
     <br>
     <h2 class="button-accordion">SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY</h2>
     <div class="box-accordion">
     Israel's National Cyber Bureau, together with its entrepreneurial private sector, has produced world-leading cyber technologies that are being employed in the United States. In 2015, New York signed an agreement with Israeli authorities to protect its critical state-wide water and power infrastructure. Cybersecurity was an important focus of the 2014 MOU signed by California Governor Jerry Brown and Prime Minister Netanyahu. Nationally, the Department of Homeland Security continues to work with its Israeli counterparts to deepen cooperation.

     	<span class="partner-quote">"Israel has become a laboratory for developing the best tactics and indigenous technologies. U.S. law enforcement can only benefit from this expertise and innovation."
</span><br><strong>SHERIFF PAUL H. FITZGERALD</strong><br><i>STORY COUNTY, IA</i>
		<br><br>
     	<span class="partner-quote">"Our exchange of ideas information with the [Israeli] Home Front Command is of substantial benefit to the National Guard in exercising its responsibilities for homeland defense."</span><br><strong>AIR FORCE GENERAL CRAIG MCKINLEY</strong><br><i>CHIEF OF THE NATIONAL GUARD BUREAU</i>
		<br><br>
     	<span class="partner-quote">"There is no other country that shares the same values and overarching goal to allow others to live in peace. We share the same threats where nations wish to obliterate our way of life and our very lives from the face of the earth. We are both democracies with the messy argumentative style government that allow all persons to have a voice and a vote. Our only friend in a very dangerous part of the world. We share many bonds and each needs the other."</span><br><strong>SHERIFF LARRY AMERSON</strong><br><i>CALHOUN COUNTY, ALABAMA</i>
    <strong>DID YOU KNOW?</strong><br>
    In 2014, Congress, working closely with the pro-Israel community, passed legislation authorizing new U.S.-Israel research pilot programs in emergency services, explosives detection and border, maritime and aviation security.
