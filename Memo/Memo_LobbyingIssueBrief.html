<div class="issue-brief-subhead">COUNTER IRAN’S REGIONAL AGGRESSION</div>
Iran—the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism—remains the greatest long-term threat to Israel and U.S. interests in the Middle East. Since the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran has increased its troublesome behavior. America should respond decisively to let Tehran know it will face severe consequences if it does not cease its aggression and comply with its international obligations.
<br /><br />

<i>IRAN’S BALLISTIC MISSILE PROGRAM IS GROWING.</i><br />
Iran possesses the largest, most diverse stockpile of ballistic missiles in the Middle East. U.N. Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 2231, adopted in July 2015, calls upon Iran “not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology, until the date eight years after the JCPOA Adoption Day.”
<br /><br />

Nonetheless, Iran has carried out at least 15 ballistic missile tests since then—the size and payload capacity of each make them inherently capable of carrying nuclear warheads. Several of the tested missiles have also been emblazoned with the words “Israel must be wiped out.”
<br /><br />

<i>IRAN IS BOLSTERING ITS CONVENTIONAL MILITARY.</i><br />
With increased cash flow as a result of sanctions relief under the nuclear deal, Iran has begun updating its aging military technology. Over the last two years, Iran has nearly doubled its defense budget. In late 2016, Iran deployed and declared operational the advanced Russian S-300 air defense system. Iran is also planning to upgrade its air force with advanced Russian fighters which it hopes to employ well beyond its borders.
<br /><br />

<i>IRAN FUNDS AND ARMS HEZBOLLAH.</i><br />
Hezbollah is a de facto arm of Iran and its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Iran provides the terrorist group with military, economic and diplomatic support. It transfers an estimated $800 million to $1 billion to Hezbollah annually; it also furnishes massive weapons transfers—including many of Hezbollah’s 150,000 rockets and missiles.
<br /><br />

<i>IN SYRIA, IRAN IS MOVING CLOSER TO ISRAEL.</i><br />
Iran has deployed thousands of IRGC personnel to Syria. The IRGC arms, trains and funds tens of thousands of Syrian forces, Hezbollah terrorists, and Shia militiamen. Some of these forces have operated directly on Israel’s northern border along the Golan Heights.
<br /><br />

<i>THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF CONGRESS</i><br />
While former President Obama and President Trump both imposed targeted sanctions against entities involved in Iran’s missile program, the growing Iranian threat demands a comprehensive strategy to push back against Tehran’s malign activities. As part of this strategy, Congress should adopt new legislation to strengthen sanctions against entities supporting Iran’s ballistic missile and conventional weapons programs in violation of UNSCR 2231. Such sanctions would in no way violate the letter or spirit of the JCPOA. As then-President Obama wrote in August 2015, “Critically, I made sure that the United States reserved its right to maintain and enforce existing sanctions and even to deploy new sanctions to address those continuing concerns, which we fully intend to do when circumstances warrant.”

<div class="issue-brief-subhead">SUPPORT SECURITY ASSISTANCE TO ISRAEL AND A ROBUST FOREIGN AID BUDGET</div>
U.S. security assistance to Israel is the most tangible manifestation of American support for the Jewish state. Today, Israel faces an unprecedented array of threats stemming from the growing instability and chaos gripping the region. These challenges require a significant increase in Israeli defense expenditures. American aid is vital to ensuring Israel can defend itself—by itself—and maintain its qualitative military edge over its adversaries.
<br /><br />

<i>U.S. SUPPORT IS CRUCIAL TO ISRAEL’S SECURITY.</i><br />
In a Middle East that is increasingly uncertain and chaotic, Israel is the one stable, reliable, democratic ally that the United States can consistently count on. The U.S.-Israel relationship is built on an unshakable commitment to shared democratic values and interests, including the rule of law, human rights, and freedoms of speech and religion. Aid to Israel helps provide the resources it needs to remain strong and deter any combination of forces arrayed against it. U.S. support helps deter conflict by making it clear to potential foes that they cannot defeat the Jewish state.
<br /><br />

<i>ISRAEL FACES INCREASED THREATS AND COSTS.</i><br />
Israel faces significant threats stemming from direct challenges to the Jewish state as well as growing regional chaos. To the north, Israel confronts terrorist groups including Hezbollah and the Islamic State (ISIS), and to the south it faces Hamas in Gaza and ISIS in the Sinai Peninsula. Israel’s greatest threat remains Iran, which is building up its military and actively working to destabilize the region. These challenges require a significant increase in Israeli defense expenditures. Israel spends more on defense as a percentage of GDP than any other nation in the industrialized world. The rising costs of advanced weaponry compound Israel’s challenges.
<br /><br />

<i>SECURITY ASSISTANCE SERVES U.S. INTERESTS.</i><br />
Cooperation between the two democracies in intelligence, homeland security, missile defense and counterterrorism has helped the United States meet its own growing security challenges. America and Israel share vital technologies and techniques that greatly benefit both countries, including cyber, unmanned vehicles, sensors and electronic warfare systems, battlefield medicine and advanced defenses for military vehicles.
<br /><br />

<i>FOREIGN AID BOLSTERS U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY.</i><br />
At just one percent of the budget, U.S. foreign aid is a cost-effective and relatively small investment that saves U.S. taxpayer money. Spending on foreign aid today is cheaper than military dollars that may need to be spent tomorrow. Effective U.S. foreign aid programs help prevent terrorist attacks, weapons proliferation, pandemic disease, humanitarian crises, economic meltdown, societal collapse and the spread of radical ideology.
<br /><br />

<i>THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF CONGRESS</i><br />
Congress should demonstrate America’s unwavering commitment to Israel by supporting $3.1 billion for U.S. security assistance to Israel, in accordance with the current Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the two countries, and full funding for joint U.S.-Israel missile defense cooperation. Congress should also support a robust foreign aid budget, and oppose disproportionate cuts, in order to ensure America’s strong leadership position in the world.

<div class="issue-brief-subhead">FIGHT THE DELEGITIMIZATION OF ISRAEL</div>
Every day Israel faces unfair criticism from the United Nations, international organizations, and activists that seek to stigmatize, delegitimize and isolate the Jewish state. From the U.N. Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, Israel is under assault. The United States has long led the effort to fight anti-Israel bias at the U.N. and beyond, but it can and must do more.
<br /><br />

<i>THE U.N. HAS A LONG HISTORY OF BIAS TOWARD ISRAEL.</i><br />
While the United Nations played a crucial role in the creation of Israel, its history has been marked by persistent antagonism toward the Jewish state. The world forum has constantly questioned Israel’s legitimacy and isolated it politically. From the 1975 “Zionism is Racism” resolution, to the more recent Security Council Resolution 2334, the U.N. unfairly singles out Israel.
<br /><br />

<i>U.N. STRUCTURES PERPETUATE ANTI-ISRAEL PREJUDICE.</i><br />
Within the U.N. system, multiple bodies—like the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People—focus exclusively on promoting the Palestinian narrative. These bodies carry out some of the worst of the U.N.’s anti-Israel activity.
<br /><br />

<i>THE UNHRC IS HOSTILE TO ISRAEL.</i><br />
The UNHRC is one of the most hostile, anti-Israel organizations in the U.N. system, dedicating an inordinate amount of effort to criticizing Israel. The Council maintains scrutiny of Israel as its only country-specific standing agenda item. In March 2016, the Council called both for blacklisting all companies conducting business in “Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem,” and creating a database to assist in this endeavor.
<br /><br />

<i>THE UNHRC AND BDS MOVEMENT HINDER PEACE.</i><br />
By eschewing direct talks, blacklisting companies, and threatening Israel with economic penalties if it does not accept Palestinian positions, the UNHRC and the broader BDS movement undermine the prospects for peace. Peace will be best achieved if the Palestinians are willing to join Israel in direct talks with the goal of two states—the Jewish State of Israel living in peace and security with a demilitarized Palestinian state.
<br /><br />

<i>THE U.S. HAS LED THE FIGHT AGAINST ANTI-ISRAEL BIAS.</i><br />
The United States has long opposed anti-Israel activity at the U.N. and efforts to boycott Israel. In the 1970s, Congress passed key legislation to prevent American companies from complying with the Arab League boycott of Israel. Recently, Congress mandated anti-BDS provisions be included in U.S. trade agreements.
<br /><br />

<i>THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF CONGRESS</i><br />
Congress must continue to fight the delegitimization of Israel and insist that the United Nations end its anti-Israel bias. Congress should adopt legislation to prohibit U.S. companies from cooperating with efforts by international organizations—including the U.N.—to boycott Israel. Congress should also make clear that if the UNHRC fails to tangibly improve its performance, the United States will reconsider its relationship with the body.
