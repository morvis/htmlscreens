<div class="memo-blurb">The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) is one of the most hostile, anti-Israel organizations in the U.N. system. While serious human rights crises are unfolding around the world - especially in the Middle East - the UNHRC dedicates an inordinate amount of effort to criticizing Israel. At the end of its March session, the UNHRC is scheduled to vote on multiple anti-Israel resolutions. The UNHRC must end this blatant anti-Israel bias.</div>

<div class="memo-subhead">The U.N. Human Rights Council has a history of attacking Israel.</div>
<ul>
	<li>The UNHRC has passed 67 resolutions condemning the Jewish state since its inception in 2006, more than it has levied against all other countries combined.</li>
    <li>Following Israel's response to attacks instigated by the terrorist organization Hamas in 2008-2009 and 2014, the UNHRC organized commissions of inquiry that produced predictably anti-Israel reports.</li>
    <li>More than a quarter of the UNHRC's special sessions have focused on censuring Israel.</li>
	<li>Agenda Item Seven is the clearest manifestation of the UNHRC's anti-Israel bias, requiring that Israel's human rights record be debated at every Council session - the only country-specific item on its standing agenda.</li>
</ul>

<div class="memo-subhead">The U.N. Human Rights Council continues to single out Israel.</div>
<ul>
	<li>On March 24, 2016, the Human Rights Council passed a resolution - under Agenda Item Seven - which called for blacklisting all companies conducting business in "Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem," and the creation of a database to assist in this endeavor.</li>
    <li>The database resolution was one of five anti-Israel resolutions passed by the UNHRC that day; only one other country-specific resolution passed.</li>
	<li>Also on March 24, 2016, the Human Rights Council confirmed the appointment of controversial Canadian academic Michael Lynk as "Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967."
    	<ul>
        	<li>Contrary to the official title, this position is charged solely with investigating "Israel's violations of the principles and bases of international law"; thus it disregards human rights violations committed by the Palestinian Authority, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and others.</li>
            <li>Whereas the terms of all other UNHRC Special Rapporteurs must be renewed, the Israelfocused Special Rapporteur's term is open-ended.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Most recently, on Sept. 26, 2016, the Council's Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women Dubravka Simonovic issued a statement that blamed Israel for Palestinian violence against women. The United States has spoken out forcefully against the anti-Israel bias at the Human Rights Council and the U.N.</li>
    <li>On March 1, 2017, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs Erin M. Barclay said, "The United States also remains deeply troubled by the [Human Rights] Council's consistent unfair and unbalanced focus on one democratic country, Israel."</li>
    <li>Barclay further stated: "The obsession with Israel through Agenda Item Seven is the largest threat to the [Human Rights] Council's credibility... When it comes to human rights, no country should be free from scrutiny - but neither should any democratic country be regularly subjected to unfair, unbalanced, and unfounded bias."</li>
	<li>On Feb. 16, 2017, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley said, "The United States is determined to stand up to the U.N.'s anti-Israel bias."</li>
</ul>
